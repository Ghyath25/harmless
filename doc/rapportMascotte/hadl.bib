@inproceedings{BBT-03,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a validation approach for real-time applications using simulation techniques. Simulation concerns the operational architecture and takes into account the executable code of real-time tasks and the execution support model: set of processors, network and basic software (real-time executive and communication system). We show in this paper the performances that can be reached for the analysis of the temporal behaviour of real-time programs in a distributed system.},
