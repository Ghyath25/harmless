Using a file system inside a bare-model application, using the host operating system file system.  
It has been tested using the newlib compiled with no syscall option
(--disable-newlib-supplied-syscall)

********************
HOWTO TO USE IT
********************
* update Makefile and uncomment line:
  #USE_IO_STUBS = 1
* (re)compile the simulator (make python). During the make process, files ioStubs.c and ioStubs.h
  will be copied from the simulatorSource/ path. If the example is copied in another location, you
  will have to copy these files manually.

then, to compile an application, add the file 'stub.c' from ApplicationSource/ to your project (see the example provided)

********************
EXAMPLE
********************

A simple example that read a (host) file and outputs its contents to the serial I/O is in example/ directory.
